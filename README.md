# Home Assistant Core installation method support


Since Home Assistant officially no longer provides official support for the Home Assistant Core installation method, here we attempt to continue supporting this installation method in an alternative way.


```

We have deprecated the following installation methods:

Home Assistant Core installation method, where you run your system in a Python environment, not to be confused with Container (for example, running your system in Docker).
Home Assistantâ€™s Supervised installation method, which involves running your own operating system, then installing the Supervisor and other requirements on top of that.

```
