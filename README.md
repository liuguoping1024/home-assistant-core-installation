We have deprecated the following installation methods:

Home Assistant Core installation method, where you run your system in a Python environment, not to be confused with Container (for example, running your system in Docker).
Home Assistantâ€™s Supervised installation method, which involves running your own operating system, then installing the Supervisor and other requirements on top of that.
